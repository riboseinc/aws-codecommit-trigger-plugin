<div>
The time, in seconds, to wait for a message to arrive in the queue (long polling). Values can be
from 1 to 20. Default is 20.
<p/>
Larger values reduce the number of requests that need to be sent. It is recommended to use the
maximum value. Reduce the value only if you experience issues and are certain that a shorter
request timeout fixes them.
