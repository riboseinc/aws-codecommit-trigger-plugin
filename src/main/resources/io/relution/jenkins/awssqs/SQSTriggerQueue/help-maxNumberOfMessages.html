<p>
The maximum number of messages to receive per request. AWS SQS never returns more messages than
this value but may return fewer. Values can be from 1 to 10. Default is 10.
</p>
<p>
All of the messages are not necessarily returned.
Larger values can reduce the number of requests that need to be sent if multiple messages are
available. It is recommended to use the maximum value. Reduce the value only if you experience
issues and are certain that a smaller number fixes them.
